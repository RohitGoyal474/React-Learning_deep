# difference between jsx and html+js

- jsx is not html where we can write js.
- jsx is itself is a different syntax or language. which is look like html +js
- eg =>

  - in jsx == const handing=<h1 a:asd> hello world <h1>
  - in react core == react.createelement("h1",{a:asd},"helloworld")
    they both are same.

- jsx is converted into reactelement using Babel

# converting jsx => html ans js , converting reactElement =>html +js

- reactelement -> react js object -> html elment

- jsx -> reactelement(with use of babel) -> react js object -> html elment
